find a dollar in CAS 207
go to tacoBell, buy a single taco
sell it to Ahmed's grandma, she will give a random number of dollars between 1 and 5
	repeat as many times as you'd like
go to pleger's office, feed him taco
	he loves it so much he sets up a meeting with the most powerful person he knows, the US president
travel to white house
you see what looks like Trump, give him taco
	oh no! it was a blonde rat and he took your taco
continue on to trump's office to give HIM a taco
he has an epiphany, the UN should know of this marvelous creation
takes you to UN via Air Force One -> you may travel around AF1 for a limitted number of turns, have cool stuff. genie lamp?
talk to *someone* at UN, they mandate all countries must have a taco bell
	you happen to arrive on the hird tuesday of September(the start of the annual session fo the General Assembly)
	when I have everyone try the taco bell, they aggree to skip the first two steps in the UN cycle (debate & negotiation)
	and go straight to the third step, decision
	then the fourth step, implementation falls to the player
	while the fifth step, reporting, is unnecessary since everyone will love the tacos and TacoBell will be an international celebration
get to all countries by walking -> New Zealand is still a mystery... Maybe a chinese boat?


taco uses:
	feed to pleger
	feed to trump rat
	feed to real trump
	feed to someone at UN
	feed highway men on some perilous road to keep them from killing you - OR - a sum of money earned from Ahmed's Gma
	one for each country you must visit to start them on their way (4)
